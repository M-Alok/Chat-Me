# Chat-Me
Built a real-time chat application using the MERN stack (MongoDB, Express.js, React, Node.js) with Socket.io for instant messaging. The app features user authentication, one-on-one and group chats, and real-time message updates. Zustand manages state efficiently, while Tailwind CSS ensures a modern UI. Cloudinary handles media uploads for profile pictures and shared images. The backend, built with Express.js, connects to MongoDB for storing user data and messages. With WebSockets, messages are delivered instantly. This project showcases your expertise in full-stack development, real-time data handling, and seamless UI/UX design, making it a strong portfolio addition.
